# Integrating Tree Ring and Weather Data for Combating Illegal Logging : A Machine Learning Approach

## Abstract
Our pioneering study addresses the global issue of illegal logging by seamlessly integrating tree ring and climate data. Leveraging the International Tree-Ring Data Bank and OpenMeteo Historical Weather Data API, we meticulously constructed a dataset featuring 11,508 trees across 693 sites, focusing on 28 pine species in the USA. Our robust data processing pipeline tackles challenges in parsing diverse tree ring data and efficiently handling large-scale weather data retrieval. Two groundbreaking models are introduced: a Verification Model achieving an impressive 89.53% accuracy in discerning the likelihood of a logâ€™s origin, and a Location Prediction Model ambitiously predicting tree locations based solely on tree ring measurements, employing Dynamic Time Warping and Haversine distance. The paper addresses ethical concerns such as false litigation, invasive data collection, and disruptions to supply chains. Our interdisciplinary research not only combats illegal logging but also contributes to the discourse on the ethical, effective, and innovative use of advanced data analytics in conservation efforts.
